# BANK-WEBSITE
THE GRIP BANK - Basic Banking System This project is part of my Web Development Internship at The Sparks Foundation under GRIP 2024. It involves creating a Basic Banking System website where virtual money can be transferred between multiple users. The website also keeps track of banking transactions and activities.
Features:
Dummy Data: Includes information for up to 10 customers.
Customers Table: Displays basic customer details such as name, account number, email, and current balance.
Transaction Status: Records the status of each transaction.
Transfer History: Maintains a transfer table that logs all transactions made.

Languages used:-
The webpage integrates HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity, Google Fonts for typography, Bootstrap for layout and components, and AOS for scroll animations. These technologies collectively contribute to the design and functionality of the "Basic Banking System" web page.
